                When my daughter Anna was just one, my busy work schedule forced me to make a heartbreaking decision—I sent her back to China to be cared for by family. But at age two, she suddenly fell gravely ill. She convulsed, foamed at the mouth—it was terrifying. We rushed her to the hospital, but no one could diagnose or treat her condition.

                I was devastated, but as a mother, I refused to accept this fate. I took control of her diet, preparing every meal from scratch, researching food therapy, and selecting only natural, nutritious ingredients. For two years, she never ate takeout or food from outside. I observed her progress, adjusted her diet, and held onto hope.

                This is why I created De Nature Healthy Lunch Box—to provide children with nutritious, balanced, and delicious meals that support their health, focus, and growth. I know many parents want the best for their kids but don't always have time to prepare fresh, healthy lunches. De Nature makes it easier.
