              How a Mother's Love, a Child's Crisis, and Psalm 128:3 Led to a Plant-Based Mission
            </h3>
            <p>
              I never set out to promote plant-based eating. I was just a mom—tired, busy, and doing my best. But everything changed when my daughter Anna turned two and suddenly got very sick.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her seizures came out of nowhere—violent, unexplained, and terrifying. We rushed from hospital to hospital, but doctors could only offer uncertainty. One chilling warning stuck with me: "If she has another seizure, her brain might be permanently damaged."
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-2" style={{ color: '#204B2A' }}>A Table Transformed</h4>
            <p>
              I couldn't just accept that. As a mother, I had to do something. That's when I started exploring every possible solution—and eventually, it led me to food.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began cooking every meal myself. No more takeout, no more processed food. I used only whole, fresh, natural ingredients. I knew I couldn't control everything, but nutrition was something I could take charge of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slowly, something amazing happened. Her health started improving. It wasn't instant, but it was real. Her energy came back. Her eyes sparkled again, and the seizures never returned. No doctor could explain why—but I could feel it: food was healing her.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-2" style={{ color: '#204B2A' }}>Rooted in Purpose</h4>
            <p>
              This experience didn't just change Anna—it changed me. I dove into nutrition, reading, experimenting, learning. When I heard Dr. Eddie Ramirez talk about the healing power of a whole-food, plant-based diet, everything clicked. What he said confirmed what I had seen for myself: real food has real power.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I started De Nature. It's not just a business—it's a calling. It's how I share the hope and lessons from my journey, helping others find healing and transformation through food.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-2" style={{ color: '#204B2A' }}>More Than a Meal</h4>
            <p>
              Every plant-based meal I make now is an act of love. It's for the tired mom who wants a better life for her child. For the busy worker who wants to be healthy but doesn't know where to start.
            </p>
            <p>
              De Nature isn't just about what's in the box. It's about what's around the table. 
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-6 py-4 my-6 bg-[#f9f9f6] text-lg italic text-[#5A5A4A]" style={{ borderColor: '#E6E6D6' }}>
              Psalm 128:3 says, "Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              To me, this is about the olive shoots—fragile, beautiful, and full of hope. It's about faith—the belief that healing can start with something as simple as the food on our table.
